  # üìà Stock Price Prediction Using Transformer and Time2Vec
**Author:** Abhishek Kotwani  
**Project Type:** Time Series Forecasting  
**Status:** Completed
---

## üîç Overview
This project implements a **Transformer-based model** for stock price prediction using historical stock data. It incorporates **Time2Vec** for time feature encoding, ensuring meaningful temporal representations. The dataset is fetched using **Yahoo Finance**, and the model is trained with **PyTorch**.  

Unlike traditional **LSTMs** or **ARIMA models**, Transformers leverage **self-attention** to capture long-term dependencies in financial time-series data. This approach enhances prediction accuracy and better captures stock price trends compared to conventional models.

‚úÖ **Implement Time2Vec** for effective time representation  
‚úÖ **Data normalization** using MinMaxScaler and Quantile Transformer

## üìä Data Preparation

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Source**
- üíæ **Yahoo Finance:** Automatically fetches stock price data for training and testing.  
- The dataset includes:
  - **Open, High, Low, Close** prices
  - **Volume**
  - **Technical indicators** (Exponential Moving Average, MACD) are not included we have calculated them manually.   

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing**
- Compute **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)** for trend tracking.
- Calculate **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** for momentum analysis.
- Generate **time-based features** for improved predictions.
- Normalize using:
  - **MinMaxScaler** (macd , ema, time2vec)
  - **Quantile Transformer** (close , open , high , low , volume)
-  choice of scaler depends on the stock, if very skewed data (common in stock price data) -log+quantile transform , if nearly normal distribution-MinMaxScaler.
### **3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Load Data**
- **yfinance:** Fetches stock data dynamically.
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Prepare data
    input_features, feature_scaler, time_scaler, close_scaler, scaled_close= create_input('TATAMOTORS.BO')
    # Replace 'TATAMOTORS.BO' with the desired stock name.
```

## **üõ† Model Implementation**
**1Ô∏è‚É£ Model Architecture**
  - The model is built using Transformer layers specifically adapted for time-series forecasting:
  
  - Multi-Head Self-Attention to capture dependencies between time steps.
  - Positional Encoding & Time2Vec to preserve time-step order.
  - Feed-Forward Layers for final prediction.
  - Hubber Loss to optimize training.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Why Time2Vec?**
  - Time2Vec is used to encode time information effectively, improving the model's ability to capture periodic patterns in stock data.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training & Optimization**
  - **Batch size:** 64
  - **Optimizer:** Adam
  - **Learning rate:** 0.0001
  - **Loss function:** MSE Loss
  - **Number of epochs:** 50-100 (adjustable based on performance)

## üèÜ Model Evaluation
- Train-test split with 80-20% data division.
- **Metrics used for performance evaluation:**
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- **Visualization:**
  - Actual vs. Predicted stock prices plotted using Matplotlib..
  - Helps assess how well the model tracks stock price trends.

## üõ† Future Enhancements

1. **Hybrid Model Integration**

   - Combine the Transformer with other models (e.g., LSTMs, CNNs, or traditional regression- 
    based models) to leverage their strengths and improve prediction accuracy.

2. **Sudden Price Surge Prediction**

   - Enhance the model to better predict sudden spikes in stock prices, which are currently 
     underestimated.

3. **Feature Engineering Improvements**

   - Experiment with additional technical indicators (e.g., RSI, Bollinger Bands) to provide 
     more insights to the model.
4. **Time2Vec**
   - Make time2vec trainable to automatically choose paramters.

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Data Scaling and Preprocessing
#### Challenges:
- Traditional min-max scaling failed to adapt to changing market regimes.
- Extreme price movements led to scaling instability.
- Different features (price, volume, indicators) required different scaling approaches.

#### Solutions:
- Implemented adaptive scaling with sliding windows.
- Applied log transformation before scaling for price data.
- Quantile transformer on the log transformations.
- Developed feature-specific scaling strategies.


---

### 2. Loss Function Design
#### Challenges:
- Standard MSE loss led to conservative predictions.
- Difficulty in balancing short-term vs long-term accuracy.
- Inadequate handling of directional movements.
- Poor performance during market regime changes.

#### Solutions:
- Huber loss for robustness.
